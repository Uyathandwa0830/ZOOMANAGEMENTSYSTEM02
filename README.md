This project simulates the administration of animals in a zoo by implementing a Virtual Zoo administration System in C#. The system demonstrates the concepts of object-oriented programming by enabling the addition, tracking, and interaction with different kinds of animals. 

*Aspects* 

- Lightweight data structure structures (DietInfo) 
- Data classification enums (AnimalType, FoodType, HabitatType) 
- Abstract classes and interfaces (Animal, IClimbable, ISwimmable, IFlyable) for common animal behaviors 
- Encapsulation between public and private domains 
- Handling errors and exceptions with custom exceptions and try-catch blocks 

*Tasks 1* 

Utilizing Enums and Structures is Task 1 

- Made enums for AnimalType, FoodType, and HabitatType; defined structs for DietInfo 

Task 2: Abstraction Implementation* 

- Created the abstract Animal class and its abstract methods. Consume, Move, and Talk 
- Developed the IClimbable, ISwimmable, and IFlyable interfaces for cross-category functionality. 

Task 3: Encapsulation Implementation* 

- Made sure that every class field is private and can only be accessed by public methods or properties. 
- Properties were used to restrict access to class fields with particular get and set criteria.

 Task 4: Managing Errors and Exceptions 

- Try-catch blocks were added to address any runtime issues. 
- Developed unique exceptions for particular zoo operational failures 

Application

To communicate with the Virtual Zoo Management System, launch the application. 
- Include animals, monitor their environment and food, and engage with them 
- Watch how exception management and error handling are implemented. 

Note

This project, which builds on Formative Assessment 2, illustrates the concepts of C# error handling, abstraction, encapsulation, and object-oriented programming.
